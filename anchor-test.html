        <strong>Yesterday</strong>

        All my troubles seemed so far away
        Now it looks as though they're here to stay
        Oh, I believe in yesterday
        Suddenly
        I'm not half the man I used to be
        There's a shadow hangin' over me
        Oh, yesterday came suddenly
        Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
        I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
        Yesterday
        Love was such an easy game to play
        Now I need a place to hide away
        Oh, I believe in yesterday
